# Introduction to Computer Science – Laboratory Exercises

This repository contains laboratory assignments for the **Introduction to Computer Science** course.
The main focus of these labs is learning **basic algorithms** and **fundamental programming concepts** using the **C programming language**.

---

## 📌 Contents

The folder includes solutions to laboratory tasks such as:

* Basic input and output operations
* Conditional statements (`if`, `switch`)
* Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)
* Functions
* Arrays and simple data processing
* Mathematical and logical algorithms
* Problem-solving using structured programming

Each laboratory task is implemented as a separate `.c` or `.cpp` source file.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies

* **Programming language:** C (some files may use C++)
* **Compiler:** GCC / MinGW (or any standard C compiler)
* **Environment:** Console-based programs

## ▶️ How to Compile and Run

Example using GCC:

```bash
gcc program.c -o program
./program
```

For C++ files:

```bash
g++ program.cpp -o program
./program
```
